# Route-planner
This Route Planner Web App is a simple, browser-based application designed to help users visualize and plan travel routes on an interactive map. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it integrates the Leaflet.js API to provide accurate, real-time mapping and routing functionalities.

The app allows users to select start and destination points, calculate routes, and display them on the map with distance and duration details. It's lightweight, responsive, and works entirely on the frontend using free and open-source tools.
